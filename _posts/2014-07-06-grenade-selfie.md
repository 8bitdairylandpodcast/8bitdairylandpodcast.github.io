[Ilana Sufrin] joins the Mark and Alex to occupy third chair on your favorite kind of regular but not really video game and technology internet jambaroo that we call 8-Bit Dairyland. She talks about her experience starting at the [Flatiron School] in NYC, as well as her experience with oversized beverages. Alex attempts to teach Mark [Swift], but fails to make a compelling case for breaking all your apps with the iOS 8 beta, unless you're actually testing stuff. All that and, yes, video games! Alex likes [Mario Kart 8] as long as you have no followup questions whatsoever; Mark wonders if the south side of Chicago could make it into a video game like [Watch Dogs] without getting an AO rating.
