In a world where technology and video podcasts are legion, only one rises above, co-mingling midwest nice with big-city vagina jokes in a glorious, barely-iTunes-legal production that took an unscheduled hiatus for a year or so. No more! Alex and Mark return to figure out where [WhatsApp fits into Facebook]'s Disney-esque pulsating blob of unrelated but surgically-fused social media technologies, and learn a bit about content delivery networks and net neutrality along the way. Also, Mark might be breaking economic sanctions with Russia to make money off of Team Fortress 2 hats. This is 8-Bit Dairyland's first episode of season 2.
