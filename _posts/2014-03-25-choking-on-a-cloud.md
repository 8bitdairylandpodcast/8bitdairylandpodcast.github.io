The grand scope of the internet cloud is considered by Mark and Alex this week. [If the US steps away from ICANN], does the internet have the wherewithal to forge it's own future? If a Titan falls, do Microsoft's Azure datacenters have enough flops to make the AI driving his robot buddies smart enough to beat ten-year-olds screaming into their Xbox headsets? Will the boys use the vast connective power of the modern web to do any kind of research or fact finding before they have an opinion on [whatever VR thing Sony has] to face off against the Oculus Rift? ALL THAT AND BEERS in this sort of holiday-themed second episode of 8-Bit Dairyland Season 2.
